# Voice Assistant Project

This project is a voice assistant built using the Azure Speech to Text (STT) and Azure Text to Speech (TTS) services. It is implemented in the C programming language. The voice assistant can convert spoken language into written text using STT and provide synthesized speech output using TTS.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

1. Azure subscription: You need an active Azure subscription to access the Azure Speech services. You can create a free account on the Azure portal if you don't have one.
2. . C development environment: Set up a C development environment with a compiler and necessary libraries.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Build the project using your C compiler. Refer to the compiler's documentation for specific instructions.

3. Run the compiled executable to start the voice assistant.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, the voice assistant can be used to convert speech to text and generate synthesized speech output. Here are the basic steps:

1. Invoke the voice assistant by triggering the start command or any other method specific to your implementation.

2. Speak into the microphone or audio input device connected to your computer.

3. The voice assistant will use the Azure Speech to Text service to convert your speech into text.

4. The text output will be processed and appropriate actions will be taken based on the voice assistant's capabilities. You can customize the actions and responses according to your requirements.

5. The voice assistant may generate synthesized speech output using the Azure Text to Speech service to respond to queries or provide information.

6. Continue the conversation by speaking and listening to the voice assistant.

## Customization

You can customize the voice assistant to fit your specific needs. Here are a few areas you might consider:

1. Add functionality: Extend the voice assistant's capabilities by incorporating additional services or APIs, such as natural language processing, third-party APIs, or IoT device control.

2. Improve speech recognition accuracy: Experiment with different parameters and techniques provided by the Azure Speech SDK to enhance the accuracy of speech-to-text conversion.

3. Enhance responses: Customize the voice assistant's responses by modifying the logic and text generation algorithms to provide more informative or engaging interactions.

4. UI integration: Integrate the voice assistant with a graphical user interface (GUI) or other input/output mechanisms to provide a seamless user experience.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the voice assistant project, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify Azure Speech service credentials: Double-check the subscription key and region provided in the `config.h` file.

2. Check network connectivity: Ensure that your computer has a working internet connection to communicate with the Azure Speech services.

3. Debugging: Utilize the debugging capabilities of your C development environment to identify and resolve any runtime errors or exceptions.
